# Salesforce Timesheet App

A comprehensive, native Salesforce timesheet management application for tracking employee hours, managing projects and charge codes, and streamlining approvals and reporting.

## Overview

This project provides a complete timesheet solution built with Salesforce-native technologies (Custom Objects, Apex, Lightning Web Components, Flows, and Salesforce DX metadata). It is designed to be configurable and extensible for most organizations that need time tracking, absence reporting, and simple billing workflows.
